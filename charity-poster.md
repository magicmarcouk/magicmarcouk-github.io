Between 1977 and 1996 Marco ran the backstage bar in the 'Hammersmith Odeon' (now known as the Hammersmith Apollo). During this time Marco became known for performing magic to his customers who were mainly people in the music industry, artists who played at the venue, their guests, road crew and press. It became known as 'Marco's Bar'.

In the early 1990s the venue became The Labatt's Apollo, and began to stage more theatre productions requiring more dressing rooms. A green room for guests was created at the front of house and the backstage bar was closed in 1996, becoming dressing room 7A.

In 2006 Phil McIntyre Entertainment presented 'Little Britain' at the Hammersmith Apollo. For reasons of nostalgia they transformed dressing room 7A back into 'Marco's bar', asking Marco to manage it and entertain the guests and VIPs pre-show.
Marco involved various celebrities in some card tricks which involved cards ending up with celebrity photographs on the back and signatures on the front, and other cards signed and then stuck to the ceiling in a magical way. All the celebrities who signed the cards were either guests or performers in the 'Little Britain' tour of 2006.
The signed cards were taken from the ceiling and made into poster with the original cards fastened to the poster and donated to Comic Relief/Red Nose Day who auctioned the collection.
