  text : "We got married on 26th July and a friend suggested we have a magician to entertain our guests in the evening. Marco arrived punctually and his talents completed what was a perfect day for us. He interacted with us and our guests individually and went on to involve everyone in the room together, which was really good fun. Everyone bar none commented how friendly and above all howtalented Marco was. We recommend Marco very highly and we are sure you will not be disappointed."

  text : "Marco was first introduced to the British Marine Federation South in London and he preformed an amazing number of tricks during our 50th Anniversary dinner celebrations in Southampton. Over the years we have recommended him to many others organisations and have actually attended some of them. Each time Marco has added many more cleaver tricks which have been to the amazement of his audience. As an organisation we have called on Marco services on more than one occasion and have no hesitation in recommending him for bringing some fun and laughter to a social occasion. Wishing ever success for the future."

  text : "I bumped into Marco at a wedding fayre and was immediately blown away by his close-up magic! He later performed at a friend's wedding and his unique magic tricks kept us all entranced - he is truly brilliant. When my daughter finally sets the date the first thing I do will be to book Marco - and if he's not available she'll have to change the date!"

His presence helped to bring our guests together and get them mixing and talking. It was also lovely that her personalises his card tricks so that we all get a lovely souvenir of the day. He's thoroughly recommended"

In both cases he was the hit of the evening, great magic, very good with people and an excellant entertainer. We have found Marco to be tremendously reliable and great value for money. We would highly recommend him without any hesitation."
