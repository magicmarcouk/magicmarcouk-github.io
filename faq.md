Below you'll find the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about hiring Marco for your event:


**Q:  What is the booking process ?**

A:  Booking Marco for your event is simple. Use the online booking page to request a date. When availability is confirmed you will need to send a confirmation email with your full details. No deposit is required, full payment is to be made on the performance day on arrival or before. Payment is by transfer, cheque, or cash.


**Q: How far in advance do I need to book?**

A:  You can book for tomorrow if Marco is available. However the earlier you book the better the chance of securing your preferred date


**Q: How long should I book you for?**

A:  Timing depends on the type of event and the number of guests attending. Marco does not charge an hourly rate, but an event rate, for a duration of two hours. However, he can usually stay longer if required without extra charge. If your event has 50 to 150 guests, two hours is enough time for Marco to visit most of your guests. However if you have more then 150 guests, Marco can add a colleague from his trusted network of magicians who specialise in close-up magic.


**Q: How much does Marco charge?**

A:  Marco has been a professional magician for more than 30 years, his concept has always been value for money and quality of performance. With that in mind, Marco's fee is £350 for up to two hours for events within the M25. Outside the M25 there is a mileage charge of £1 per mile (one way).


**Q: What if I want you for less than two hours?**

A: It takes Marco the same amount of time in preparation and travelling time to attend your event, so the event fee will be the same.


**Q: How far will Marco travel for an event?**

A:  Marco will travel just about anywhere, however this will involve extra costs.


**Q: Does Marco have public liability insurance?**

A: Yes as a member of Equity the performers' union (registered as Magic Marco),  Marco has up to £10 million Public Liability Insurance (PLI).


**Q: What types of tricks does Marco do?**

A:  All types, from the classics to modern routines, and many of his own creations. Cup and ball, coins, cards, sponge, rope, rings, mind reading, and many more.
 
 
**Q: Does Marco need a table or anything setup in order to perform?**

A:  If the event is a stand up event Marco may require a small table, but will discuss with you before your event. Marco will arrive at your event ready to perform.


**Q: Does Marco do children's parties?**

A: Marco has performed at many children's parties (minimum age 6). He can even teach the birthday child a few tricks beforehand and then they can perform the routine to amaze their friends!


**Q: How does Marco integrate into an event?**

A:  This depends on the type of event, and what your preference is. For example, Marco usually performs during the reception, looking for guests who may not know others at your event or engaging guests who are not required in photos at weddings. He also often performs at tables during the main meal, focusing on guests who have finished their meals or are waiting for service. Marco can incorporate a combination of styles, and is happy to discuss your preferences and give his advice on what will work best before the event.
