 Every couple wants their wedding day to be memorable and special. It's always nice to hear your guests talking about your wedding months or even years on. Why not hire Marco as your Wedding Magician to make your day stand out? It's certainly something your guests won't forget in a hurry.
  
 Depending on the type of wedding you're having and the format of the day, Marco can perform at the time and in the style of your choice. If you're having a traditional wedding, Marco is often a great ice-breaker at the wedding reception, whilst the happy couple are being photographed. He can also perform at the wedding breakfast, lunch and dinner, which means both day and evening guests get to enjoy his magic. Alternatively, Marco can work the tables during your formal dinner; this is often a great way for your guests to get to know each other. You can choose any combination of styles to suit your special day, and Marco is happy to give advice on what has worked well at other weddings.
  
 Marco can personalise some of his tricks, for example making a photo of the newly weds magically appear on a playing card that has been randomly chosen, inspected and signed by a guest. It's a very impressive trick and your guests will  keep the card as a memento of your wedding day. He will leave guests entertained and wondering how all his amazing tricks are done!
