Depending on the type of party you are planning to host, Marco can simply work round your guests mingling during drinks, perform a stand up show, do table magic, or deliver a combination of these styles. Whatever the format of your event, Marco can fit in, and is happy to advise on what has worked well in his vast experience.
 
Marco isn't just a truly amazing Magician, he is also a fantastic entertainer. He has a great way with people and provides humour in all his performances. He works well in an informal party environment where people are mingling, drinking and enjoying themselves. He is able to judge a good time to approach a group and will perform unforgettable tricks that will leave your guests feeling amazed and in awe.
 
If you're organising a party for someone special, Marco can personalise some of his tricks, for example making their photograph magically appear on a playing card that has been randomly chosen, inspected and signed by a guest.
